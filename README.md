Operating System Algorithms Demo implemented in C 

This Repository contains some **Scheduling Algorithms** used by different operating systems _implemented in C_.
The programs are just for demo purpose and can't be really implemented in the OS.

##__Scheduling Algorithms Includes:__
1. FCFS: First Come First Serve
1. SJF: Shortest Job First
1. RR: Round Robin
1. MFQS: Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling

##__Other Algorithms:__
1. Bankers Algorithm to find the safe sequence of the given processes
1. Bankers Algorithm to check if the request for resources by a given process is valid or not.

Each Program takes input from the corresponding test files present in the folder.
